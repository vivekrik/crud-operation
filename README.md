AJAX CRUD Operations
This project demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). With AJAX, you can interact with a server without requiring a full page reload, creating a smoother and more responsive user experience.

Key Features:

Create: Add new records to your database by filling out a form and sending the data to the server asynchronously, all without leaving the current page.

Read: Retrieve and display data from your database dynamically on the web page without refreshing it, providing real-time updates.

Update: Edit and update existing records by making changes through a user-friendly interface, which updates the server in the background.

Delete: Remove records from the database gracefully with a confirmation prompt, ensuring data integrity.

This project offers a practical example of how to incorporate AJAX into your web applications to perform these essential CRUD operations seamlessly. It's a powerful technique to enhance user interaction and reduce page load times.
